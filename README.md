"Feature selection using stochastic difffusion search"
Stochastic Diffusion Search or SDS is a wrapper-based algorithm used for feature selection that is implemented along with the machine learning model. 
Feature selection using SDS has significantly improved the performance of the model. 
Various datasets like 'Bupa', Ionosphere, and 'pdspeech' have been used for the comparison purpose and to analyze the performance of the model.
Two machine learning models are implemented for this project using framework of Feature selection using SDS. (Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression).
